This repository contains the source code for `router.c`, a program written in C language for effective routing in a network environment.

## Overview

`router.c` is a command-line program designed to facilitate routing operations within a network. It provides functionalities such as:

- Validating IP addresses
- Determining network connections between routers
- Calculating the shortest path for routing purposes

## Features

- **IP Address Validation:** The program includes functions to validate IP addresses entered by the user.

- **Network Connectivity:** `router.c` determines the connections between routers based on user input.

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Using provided network connectivity information, the program calculates the shortest path for routing data packets.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation:** Compile the `router.c` file using a C compiler such as GCC.
   ```bash
   gcc router.c -o router
   ```

2. **Execution:** Run the compiled program.
